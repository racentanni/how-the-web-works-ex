<h1>Questions</h1>
1. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is how clients get data from, or send data to a server.
<br>
2. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator which is an address for an internet Resource
<br>
3. Domain Name System, which converts URLs into IP addresses
<br>
4. The query string lets one to pass key value pairs into the URL in 
    the format of ?key1=value&key2=value
    <br>
5. Get: gets data from the server (most pages, search forms)
   Post: Sends data to the server (changes data on the server)
   <br>
6. An HTTP response is the response from a server to a client which follows HTTP protocol.
<br>
7. Headers provide additional information about a request or the response
    ex: Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie.
        Response headers: Content type, Last-modified, set cookie, cache control.
        <br>
8.
<br>
    a. The browser resolves the name into an ip address using DNS
    <br>
    b. The browser then makes a request to that IP address including headers.
    <br>
    c. The server sends a response in HTML with a status code (hopefully 200).
    <br>
    d. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML and finds any other resources if needed.
    <br>
    e. The browser makes additional HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each.
